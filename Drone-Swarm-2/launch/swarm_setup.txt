1. Make gz_ws/src

2. copy ardupilot_gazebo to it (the git repo)

3. make copies of the drone model you wish to use in your simulation

4. Give all the copies unique names (1, 2, 3...):
a. model.config: <model><name>Iris 1</name></model>
b. model.sdf: <model name="iris_1"></model>

5. For each drone's sdf file, make the following changes - 
a. Change fdm port in for each drone by 9002 + 10*i, where i is the drone number
b. Add fdm port out as 90xx + 1, where 90xx is the fdm port in.

6. Go to the worlds folder and create a new sdf file. Make it a copy of any world file you find suitable . Add the drone models you copied into the sdf file, similar to how the initial drone is added in the world file:
<include>
      <name>iris_with_gimbal_1</name>
      <uri>model://iris_with_gimbal_1</uri>
      <pose degrees="true">2 0 0.195 0 0 90</pose>
</include>
Note that position must be changed.

7. In a ros workspace create a launch file. Refer to launch file two_drone.launch.py on github

8. Export the ardupilot folders as GZ Resource Paths -
export GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH=$HOME/gz_ws/src/ardupilot_gazebo/build:$GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH
export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=$HOME/gz_ws/src/ardupilot_gazebo/models:$HOME/gz_ws/src/ardupilot_gazebo/worlds:$GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH

9. In different terminals start instances of each drone using the command:

10. Launch the ros2 launch.py file. Gazebo should start. You can now control the two drones as you normally would through terminal.
Eg. - 
mode guided
arm throttle
takeoff 5


For setting up gazebo, use the ardupilot documentation as reference -
